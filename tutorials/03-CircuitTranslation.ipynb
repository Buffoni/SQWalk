    "In this notebook we will introduce a tool of `sqwalk` that is useful to decompose (or translate) an unitary transormation (in our case the one generated by the walker's Hamiltonian) into a series of gates that can be simulated or even run on quantum hardware. The decomposition method is based on `qiskit` thus we will need it as a dependency, in addition to our usual `SQWalker` class and some QuTiP objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before jumping to the tutorial, it is useful to note here that this decomposition, for the sake of being general, it is not optimized. Indeed, while it supports any kind of quantum computer and every kind of quantum walker it usually takes up a lot of gates to implement the decomposition. To optimize the number of gate one must resort to some specific techniques in the literature that leverage the symmetries and characteristics of some particular graphs and are not general."
