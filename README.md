The phyton implementation of the walker class is contained in ```sqwalk.py```.
The ```tutorials```  folder contains some tutorial notebooks to familiarize yourself with the
walker class and review the principal fatures.
SQWalk can be easily incorporated in any existing pipeline with any custom topology or 
network class, provided the adjacency matrix.
